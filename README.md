# Gender Mortality Gap: Key Causes Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the key factors contributing to the gender mortality gap, focusing on why male mortality rates remain consistently higher than female mortality rates across age groups. Using demographic, health, and behavioral data, the analysis aims to identify structural and behavioral drivers behind the observed gap.

## Data
- Public health and demographic datasets (mortality rates by gender and age)
- Socioeconomic and behavioral indicators (e.g., lifestyle risk factors, external causes of death)
- Data sources include publicly available government and international statistics

## Methodology
- Cleaned and merged multi-source datasets to construct a unified mortality-by-gender framework  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine mortality patterns across age cohorts  
- Compared cause-specific mortality rates to isolate high-impact contributors  
- Aggregated and standardized indicators to enable cross-gender comparison  

## Key Findings
- Male mortality rates exceed female mortality rates across nearly all age groups  
- External causes (e.g., accidents, occupational risks) and lifestyle-related factors contribute disproportionately to the gap  
- The gender mortality gap widens significantly during working-age years, suggesting a strong link to labor market exposure and behavioral risk  

## Visualization
An interactive Tableau dashboard was developed to illustrate:
- Mortality trends by gender and age group  
- Cause-specific contributions to the mortality gap  
- Cross-age comparisons highlighting divergence points

## Tools & Technologies
- Data Analysis: Python / R  
- Visualization: Tableau  
- Data Processing: Pandas / tidyverse  
- Reporting: Markdown

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that the gender mortality gap is driven less by biological differences alone and more by structural, behavioral, and occupational factors. The findings highlight the importance of targeted public health interventions and policy responses aimed at high-risk male populations.
